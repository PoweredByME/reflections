This is the lesson 1 of the version control and learning git.

The better version controlling will make me a better coder. Because, in this way I will be able to find the bugs in my
updated code easily and swiftly.

The pros of a manual commit is that it can be made whenever I feel like. The cons on the otherside are that maunally I 
might not commit logically rendering version control useless and inefficient.

Git saves all the files because in one commit many files might be affected. But, since Google Docs is not made to handle
code and program files so it treats each and every file as a seperate file.

We can use the "git log" command to see the ID of each of the commit and with the command "git diff" we can check out the
difference in the two commits easily.

I want to version control all my code etc...

I have made a git repo
